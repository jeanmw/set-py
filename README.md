## Simple implementation of Set game in python

Set is a cardgame in which players look for complimentary patterns of
shape, color, and texture, and number (3 possibilities in each category) in a displayed
array of cards. A set is a group of 3 cards for which each category (shape, color, texture, and number)
is either all the same or all different.

This tiny program lets your computer play set. To run, simply ensure you have python3 installed
and call `python3 set.py` from the project's directory. This will generate an array of cards and print the values for valid sets of cards as well as the number of sets present.
