## Simple implementation of Set game in python

Set is a cardgame in which players look for complimentary patterns of
shape, color, and texture, and number (3 possibilities in each category) in a displayed
array of cards. A set is a group of 3 cards for which each category (shape, color, texture, and number)
is either all the same or all different.

To run, simply call `python3 set.py`. This will generate an array of cards and print the set of cards as well as the number of sets present.
